<p>Using Microsoft’s tablet as a student, developer, artist, gamer, and musician.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Surface Pro was announced and subsequently released in 2012, and to me it was just another unobtainable luxury gadget. Fortunately for consumers (and unfortunately for stockholders), Microsoft vastly overestimated the demand for its underpowered Surface RT and pricey Surface Pro and produced millions more tablets than the market demanded. As a result at the time of writing, refurbished Surface RT and Pros run $200 and $400 respectively. Having been forced into using an iPad for several of my classes during my senior year of high school, I have found Apple’s tablet computing experience to be extremely lacking, but I still wanted a touch-centric mobile computing experience that worked. Now that the Surface was so cheap, I decided to make the leap into Microsoft’s ecosystem with Surface Pro.</p>

<h3>Prior Devices</h3>

<p>Over the years my laptops have fallen into two categories: ThinkPad and PowerBook. I used a 12" PowerBook G4 until 2012 and have been using a ThinkPad X230 since then. My tablet computing experience has been largely the iPad 4th generation. I would consider the X230 to be my "perfect" laptop and I don’t foresee the need to upgrade for years to come, especially given the "post-PC" landscape. Its Ivy Bridge i7, 8GB RAM, 500GB 840 EVO, WWAN card and most importantly monstrously long battery life will definitely serve me well in the years to come. </p>

<p>My school-sanctioned iPad, however, has been sitting unused and uncharged next to a defunct tower. I can sum up my iPad experience in two apps: Chrome and Server Auditor, an SSH app. Not exactly the epitome of productivity. The school very generously supplied a keyboard case. A sneak peak: it is inferior in every way to the Type Cover 2.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>Surface Pro’s polarizing Kickstand places it firmly above tablets, but also renders it somewhat inferior to laptops when it comes to versatility. Surface Pro 2’s dual-mode Kickstand is a large improvement, but definitely not worth the price premium. On desks and tables the Kickstand and Type Cover 2 work very well. Lap usage works best when it is possible to lean back. In a straight-backed chair, it can be difficult to get to a comfortable angle. A position where the Surface works very well is sitting cross legged with the kickstand retracted and Type Cover out. The Type Cover is in an excellent position for typing and is sufficiently supported, and the screen is also in a good position for touch input and inking.</p>

<p>The cameras are barely passable. OneNote Metro has a "document scanning" mode, but the cameras are of very low quality, making smaller scanned text (if I had to estimate, perhaps smaller than 8pt) almost unreadable. The Windows Phone 8 app Office Lens produces much better quality "scans" than Surface Pro’s cameras. I tried my best and produced the following result:</p>

<h3>Laptop Comparison</h3>

<h4>Physical</h4>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/thinkpad.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Comparing the weight of the ThinkPad to that of the Surface Pro: very similar in weight, with the X230 slightly heavier. If the X230 were to have a 9-cell instead of a 6-cell it would be much heavier and thicker. If you’re carrying it around in a backpack it doesn’t make that much of a difference overall. Surface Pro is much more usable when holding by one or both hands, though.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>I’m a big TrackPoint fan, but even compared to a PowerBook G4 touchpad I have to say that the Type Cover 2’s touchpad is nearly unusable. It’s almost worse than the X230’s similarly sized touchpad. Thankfully, the touch screen is excellent in Metro and acceptable on the desktop. For precision input pen input is also a fine option. Don’t expect to be able to play any mouse-heavy game using the touchpad.</p>

<p>As for the keyboard, the X230 wins on every front. I would also say that the PowerBook’s keyboard is better. Type Cover 2 barely has any space between keys, like the PowerBook. However, PowerBook keys are curved like most other keyboards, which makes it less likely for fingers to slide into another key. Key travel is also significantly reduced when compared to other laptop keyboards. As a consequence of the close key spacing and small travel the backlight leak is very low. </p>

<p>The key action is very clicky, which helps considerably with the lack of travel. Type Cover 2 definitely beats out cheap and mushy island-style keys that seem popular on entry-level laptops these days. Something to keep in mind: the Type Cover 2 is a scant 5mm thick. Considering the weight and thickness requirements Type Cover 2 does very well for itself.</p>

<h3>iPad Comparison</h3>

<p>In my school of about 4500 kids, most students have the school-sanctioned iPad complete with keyboard case. Next year the administration plans to require every student to take part in the iPad program next year in a push for a digital classroom. In my opinion, outfitting students with Surface Pros would not only save money over a 32 GB iPad but also be vastly more useful.</p>

<p>Being a full Core i5-powered Ultrabook, it’s not exactly fair to compare Surface Pro to the iPad. Aside from weight and battery life Surface Pro trounces iPad in pretty much every way. In light of the recent price drop, it even wins out on price despite its expensive components. Unfortunately, most consumers view Surface Pro as an iPad competitor instead of as a hybrid device.</p>

<h4>Physical</h4>

<p>Without case and Type Cover 2</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/ipad.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>With case and Type Cover 2</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/ipad-case.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Without its case, the iPad 4th generation handily beats Surface Pro in both weight and thickness. However, with the keyboard case (a must for any kind of text heavy productivity), Surface Pro is much thinner (not to mention less janky-looking). Weight with case and keyboard is pretty much the same.</p>

<h4>Input</h4>

<p>The iPad’s lack of Wacom technology (or any kind of pen technology) is one of its greatest weaknesses in the education market and artistic area. The best capacitive stylus is worlds away from Wacom’s pressure sensitivity, buttons, and palm detection. Having tried writing notes with a capacitive stylus I can confidently say that handwriting on the iPad is a painful and unrewarding experience. </p>

<p>The iPad keyboard case is fairly awful. The only positive is its slightly larger travel and key spacing (the tradeoff being smaller key size). Another big plus is the availability of Delete, Home and End keys on Type Cover. </p>

<h4>Software</h4>

<p>Another field in which Surface Pro dominates iPad is software. I’ll go over this in depth in coming sections, but first: here is a quick overview.</p>

<p>Note taking: OneNote Metro dominates every note-taking app for iPad, and OneNote 2013 is useful for more advanced tasks that may not be available in Metro.</p>

<p>Productivity: Word processing with Word is obviously much more powerful, but for those using Google Docs or similar basic word processing software the experience on the iPad is fairly similar. Multitudes of connectivity options (SkyDrive, Dropbox) and a choice of software is a positive for Surface Pro.</p>

<p>Gaming: Two words: Steam games. Also, Wii emulation.</p>

<p>Media: As a media acquisition device, uTorrent and Flash player make quick work of torrents and streams. Having USB and HDMI out makes Surface Pro very useful for mass storage and media playback. However, as a media consumption device Surface Pro falls short of the iPad. XBOX Music and the video app feel incomplete and clunky compared to the iPad’s excellent applications. </p>

<h2>Student</h2>

<p>The biggest impact that Surface Pro has made on me is as a student. Not having to deal with notebooks, folders, and papers is a ridiculous advantage. As soon as I receive new printed material it’s scanned with Office Lens and filed in OneNote.</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/physics.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>As a result of no longer having to carry notebooks or folders, I can carry all my notes and papers digitally with me in a simple messenger bag. </p>

<p>Backpack before</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/backpack-before.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Backpack after</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/backpack-after.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Inking notes in OneNote has been my primary use case. Infinitely large notebooks, pen colors, and different thicknesses makes organizing note sections much more effective. I prefer writing with a Papermate Profile 1.4b pen, a smooth and thick 1.4mm ballpoint, and the stylus point on glass is a smooth as it gets. Setting the tip thickness to "medium" produces a wonderfully thick, almost marker-like point. </p>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/onenote.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>An oft-requested feature is a touch-first version of Office, but it’s been my experience that the "touch optimized" versions of Word, PowerPoint, and OneNote have worked extremely well. I would say that simply putting existing touch-optimized versions of Office into a Metro app container would be a decent solution without too much trouble.</p>

<p>Is a Surface Pro right for you? If you like the idea of infinite digital notebooks that "just works", then OneNote with Wacom inking is your best bet.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>Development with Surface Pro and Visual Studio is largely the same as with my 768p X230. Visual Studio 2013 correctly scales the UI, making text extremely crisp but lowering the amount of information that can be displayed on the screen. If you can stand VS on a 768p screen, then you’ll be fine with VS on Surface Pro. Another option is to disable DPI scaling, trading readability for real-estate.</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/vs.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/desktop.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Running Linux on Surface Pro (or even running virtual Linux in Hyper-V) is also an option. </p>

<p>Having purchased the 64 GB model, I installed VS to the boot drive, but manually moved it to an always-inserted 64 GB microSD card and symlinked the directories to the card. The biggest culprit was the Windows Phone 8 emulation images. I noticed no lag when starting or running VS off the SD card, however updates (most noticeably Update 2 RC) took quite a while longer than normal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Type Cover 2's poor touchpad was more of a nuisance than I had imagined, especially while developing. Targeting menu items and other UI elements would undoubtedly become even more difficult if DPI scaling is disabled. I found myself reaching for the absent TrackPoint most when I in the "zone", and found the touchpad sorely lacking.</p>

<h2>Digital Art</h2>

<p>The iPad may have Paper, a very good painting and drawing app, but it can’t hold a candle to the full suite of Adobe applications and Wacom support. I never knew how well I could draw and paint until I started with Photoshop CS6 and Wacom pen. A side note: the <a href="http://us.wacom.com/en/feeldriver">Wacom Feel</a> driver is required for pressure sensitivity. </p>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/ps.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Drawing with layers and being able to create custom pencils, pens, and brushes of any type and color really allowed me to focus more on creation than on acquiring materials.</p>

<p>CS6 applications incorrectly report to Windows that they are HiDPI aware, but in reality they are not. This causes the UI to remain unscaled; buttons and icons are sharp but tiny. By the time I got around to fixing the issue, though, I found that I preferred the vastly increased screen real estate over the larger targets as constant pen usage made hitting the smaller targets possible. If finger-painting is a priority I would recommend scaling the UI. </p>

<h2>Gaming</h2>

<p>The Core i5-3317U features Intel HD 4000 graphics, which is enough for light to medium gaming. As with other heavy applications, I would recommend moving game installs to the microSD card and creating symlinks to save disk space. Notable games that run well on medium / low settings on the HD 4000 include: Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Left 4 Dead 2, Unreal Tournament 3, and Kane and Lynch 2. Saints Row the Third is barely playable at minimum resolution and settings together with <a href="http://forum.techinferno.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=17">ThrottleStop</a>.</p>

<p>Borderlands 2 runs adequately at 1366 x 768, but runs very smoothly at 800 x 600. Considering the awful touchpad on Type Cover 2, a wired XBOX 360 controller or a wireless controller with USB adapter is a welcome accessory for gaming. Nothing like playing an excellent game like Borderlands 2 with your friends on a tablet!</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/smb.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Another quality example of Surface Pro gaming is Super Meat Boy. It’s simple enough that it runs super-smooth at native 1920 x 1080, but also good-looking and a fun game to boot. It’s playable with a Type Cover, but again a controller makes gaming that much better.</p>

<p>One of my favorite games to play on my Surface is Super Smash Bros. Brawl. With a few tweaks (setting renderer to Direct3D and running audio on a separate thread), Brawl performs admirably with a minimum of lag. With four players, ThrottleStop can be useful on the more intense stages to help smooth gameplay.  "Normal" Wiimotes without built-in Motion Plus are supported natively. With an el-cheapo [Bluetooth adapter](http://www.dx.com/p/super-mini-bluetooth-2-0-adapter-dongle-vista-compatible-11866) and the Toshiba Bluetooth stack Wiimotes with Motion Plus are fully supported (even vibration and internal speaker). XBOX controllers (both wired and wireless) can also emulate GameCube input. As a side note: I have experienced problems with multiple Wiimotes connected to the cheap Bluetooth adapter; XBOX controllers have been more reliable for me. </p>

<p>With a footprint of little more than the display stood on edge (reminiscent of desktop all-in-ones), Surface Pro is an excellent casual gaming option if the games you play will run on an Intel HD 4000. Being able to start up a quick game of Brawl or Mario Party with little more than flipping out the kickstand and plugging in an adapter is an enticing feature. Now, this machine won’t replace your average gaming laptop for mobile (albeit plugged-in) gaming, but for light on-the-go fun it’s hard to beat.</p>

<h2>Music production</h2>

<p>My primary software for music production is Ableton Live together with an APC-20. Ableton runs well on the Surface Pro, but you’ll want to keep it on mains power as it consumes about 30% of the CPU pretty much constantly while live mixing with several tracks. I found it useful to disable DPI scaling in the executable Compatibility options and using the 125% UI Scaling option in Options instead. This allows for a crisp interface with more real estate than the Windows scaled option.</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/surface-pro-review/apc-40.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>An area in which I felt I was limited was the native port selection. As Surface Pro features only a single USB port, having multiple USB devices requires a hub. In addition, lack of a microphone input makes a USB mixer quite attractive. As many of my loops and clips are recorded from LSDJ, KORG DS-10 and M-01, I’ll definitely be picking up a USB-based mixer soon.
An interesting product is the Touch-cover based <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/music-photos-and-video/surface-music-kit?lc=1033">Surface Remix</a>. Unfortunately, extremely limited release means that the Remix cover is very hard to come by.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Most reviews of Surface Pro reiterate the same point over and over: it’s an Ultrabook with the features that make a high-end tablet worth considering: high density IPS display and Wacom tech. I was afraid that my Surface Pro would depose my ThinkPad as primary road warrior, and inevitably it’s become my daily driver. Writing notes in class, typing an essay while on IRC, playing Brawl with my friends, sketching after class, or mixing at home, the Surface Pro is a wonderful showcase of what Windows 8 can do when paired with proper hardware. Given the steep drop in price to $400, I would without hesitation recommend Surface Pro to anyone that is looking for a tablet, and even those who are looking for a laptop.
