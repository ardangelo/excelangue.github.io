## Apps

### Omeddle

![Omeddle Icon]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/om-icon.png) 

I finished and published this app during Microsoft's //publish/ 2014 event in Chicago, where I won 3rd place in the overall local app competition.

Don't just chat with Omegle users, meddle with them! Omeddle is not only a fully-featured Omegle client (Classic chat, ask and answer questions), but also puts a fun twist on the classic Omegle formula: not only can you chat, you can also control! Sit between two unsuspecting Omegle users and control the conversation by masquerading as the Stranger and modify messages with simple find and replace or regular expressions. 

Also features image sharing and management (upload pictures to share during a chat, as well as view and delete any image from Imgur that was uploaded during previous chats) and easy chatlog sharing with PasteBin!

### Thorntons++

![Thorntons++ Icon]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/tpp-icon.png) 

**Update Sep. 2 2014**: Thorntons++ has been pulled from the Store due to Thorntons changing loyalty and coupon system. This will require a total rewrite of Thorntons++.

Thorntons++ is my first Windows Phone app, an unofficial OpenStore client that allows you to get the latest Thorntons coupons and deals on Windows Phone 8 and to save your FREEquency Rewards card. While the official Android and iOS apps collect personal data such as location, phone number, and phone model, Thorntons++ generates this information randomly. Coupons are not erased after use and can be used offline.
